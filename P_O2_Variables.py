# Variables can be a string (note the speech marks)
greeting = "hello world"

# Variables can be a number 
fav_num = 7
num_string = "5"

# Variables can be Boolean (True/False)
love_hockey = False

# This variable has a problem
# my_name = "Christine du Preez"

print(greeting)
print(fav_num)
print(love_hockey)

print(fav_num * 2)
print(num_string * 5)

# Constants are uppercase
PI = 3.14

# Can't start character names with a number, always add a letter
a_01_my_num = 7
